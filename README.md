My name is Paul and I work as a Data Engineer at MEtis Software Solutions LLC. 

I love to learn about new technologies and user experiences with technologies. 

I am passionate about becoming an AI engineer some day and create solutions for business, research, and society.  

Some of my hovvies include reading, playing piano, and making new connections.
